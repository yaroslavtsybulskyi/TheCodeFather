Task 8:
Class Price could be used for the PaymentGateway implementation because:
 - it provides possibility to add/subtract prices safely
 - it has comparison operators
 - it has possibility of conversion to another currency
 - it has automatic rounding during the creation of price


Task 9:
Conclusion:
For simple tasks, like validation, getters/setters or properties are preferrable.
In case we are talking about some more serious logic - then descriptors should be used.
For obligatory part of the task properties are more preferrable because of simple functionality, readability,
and more pythonic code.
For extra part: since the logic becomes complicated and validation is based on different attributes -
then descriptors are better fit.
